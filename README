minimoc
mini motor controller
=====================

it's a smallish (1.7 by 0.9 inches), two-layer, single-sided motor controller
for brushless dc motors up to around 20 amps. an atmega8-series mcu drives
three half-h-bridges with the onboard pwm, reading the back emf to determine
commutation point. other onboard facilities include current measuring, some
status leds, battery voltage monitoring and an i2c interface for control.
the battery and motor connect via screw terminals, or directly soldered wire
for lower-profile circuits.

all code is licensed under the gnu public license v3, but get in touch if you
have particular needs besides that.

pcb designs are available online at the project homepage,
